### Project Description
[The Playful Infinite Lock System is a whimsical application designed to simulate an app locking mechanism that never truly locks any applications. Users can initiate a locking process, but the system ensures that they can never fully lock any app, creating a humorous and frustrating experience. This project aims to explore user interaction design through a playful lens while providing insights into app¬†development.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Traditional app lock systems provide users with security by allowing them to lock applications with PINs or patterns. However, these systems can sometimes lead to frustration if users forget their passwords or patterns. The Playful Infinite Lock System flips this concept on its head by allowing users to attempt locking apps without ever achieving that goal, leading to an amusing user experience.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[The solution is a web-based application where users can select apps they wish to "lock." Upon attempting to lock an app, the system will inform them that the locking process cannot be completed. This design creates an engaging and entertaining interaction while demonstrating the concept of infinite loops¬†in¬†software.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used:Python]
- [Frameworks used:Flask for web application development
]
- [Libraries used:Flask, Tkinter]
- [Tools used: Python,Jupyter Notebook,Web Browser]



### Implementation
For Software:
The application consists of a simple Flask server that handles user interactions through web forms. Users can select apps to lock, and upon submission, they receive feedback about the locking process.
# Installation
[clone the repostory
Install dependancies:make sure you have python installed.
install flask.
run the application. 
access the web interface]

# Run
[Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Start the Flask server by executing python app.py.
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the system.]
